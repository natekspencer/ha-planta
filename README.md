While I'm not employed by Planta, I collaborated closely with their team to provide input on the necessary data and structure for this integration and assist with testing to help shape their public API. I’ll continue to work with them to ensure ongoing improvements as needed. That said, I provide this custom component for your enjoyment and home automation needs, as-is, and without guarantees.
